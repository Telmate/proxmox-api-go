# Command LIne Interface

When this document referrers to the Command LIne Interface (CLI) it references the code in the [/cli](../../cli/) directory.

<!-- TODO Add more info.-->

## Anti Patterns

The code in [main.go](../../main.go) is deprecated and should not be added to.  Instead, add new commands to the new CLI.
